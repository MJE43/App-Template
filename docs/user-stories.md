### Implementation Notes

1. Focus on core interaction loop first:
   - Chord selection
   - Timeline management
   - Basic audio
   - Simple AI interaction

2. Technical considerations:
   - Ensure audio latency < 100ms
   - Keep UI response time < 16ms
   - Optimize Claude API calls
   - Implement efficient state management

3. Testing requirements:
   - Unit tests for core functions
   - Integration tests for AI interaction
   - Audio playback testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility

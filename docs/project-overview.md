# Progressio: AI-Enhanced Chord Progression Explorer
## Project Overview & Vision Document

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** December 20, 2024

### Project Vision

Progressio is a specialized web application designed to enhance the chord progression creation process through intelligent collaboration with AI. The platform enables musicians to explore and develop chord progressions while engaging in meaningful musical conversations with Claude AI.

### Core Competencies

1. **Intuitive Chord Entry and Visualization**
   - Streamlined timeline-based progression interface
   - Comprehensive, static chord bank with organized layout
   - Real-time audio feedback for chord selection
   - Visual keyboard representation for chord understanding
   - Support for chord variants and voicings

2. **AI-Powered Songwriting Assistance**
   - Direct conversation interface with Claude
   - Context-aware progression suggestions
   - Musical style and era-based guidance
   - Real-time collaborative refinement of ideas

### MVP Feature Set

**1. Core Interface**
- Timeline-based chord progression display
- Static chord bank with categorized layouts
- Split-screen design (70% composition / 30% chat)
- Basic project management (save, load, export)

**2. Chord Interaction**
- Click-to-add chord functionality
- Audio playback of selected chords
- Basic chord variants selection
- Real-time progression visualization

**3. Style Context**
- Genre selection interface
- Decade/era selection
- Musical mood/style parameters
- Context persistence

**4. AI Collaboration**
- Persistent chat interface with Claude
- Progression-aware conversation context
- Suggestion implementation workflow
- Session context management

### Technical Stack

   - Iterative improvement process

### Future Considerations

Features intentionally excluded from MVP but considered for future releases:
- Advanced chord voicing library
- Progression version control
- MIDI device integration
- Advanced audio playback features
- Collaborative session support
- Extended music theory analysis

### Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - Time spent exploring progressions
   - Number of AI interactions per session
   - Progression completion rate
   - User return rate

2. **Technical Performance**
   - UI response time
